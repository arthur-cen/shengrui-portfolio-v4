## **Experiences**

My life in the U.S. started at UC Berkeley(Go Bears!), where I spent four years to finish my Computer Science and Environmental Science Degree. Studying computer science wasn’t in my original plan, however, I considered myself a creative person and I had a passion for creating and building interesting things. That’s how I became a programmer. After Berkeley, I joined a Startup later as a Software Engineer and work for two years. It was then, I found it interesting to build things as a product manager! 

I decided to pursue the PM route and I was admitted to Carnegie Mellon University, Master of Integrated Innovation for Products and Services. A Long name, right? Trust me, they have longer ones. I learned a lot during that time and met a fantastic group of friends! You should really check out my project page to see what I did during my graduate school.

Now, I am graduated. I am pondering what should I do next… Oh, of course, I am job hunting, for product management roles! If you are hiring, let me know!

## **What I love to do**

I think I am an entry-level life-hacker. I love to use Apple Watch to track my daily activities, calories burnt, and intakes. I also like to try out different smart devices at home. I write iOS shortcuts to optimize my work on the phone and so on! If you are also tech-savvy or a life-hacker, we should definitely know each other!

## **A fun fact about me:**

After each time when I finish an avocado, I will grow its pit. It is an interesting experience to see how the seed grows into a plant! Reach out to me and I can show you how!
